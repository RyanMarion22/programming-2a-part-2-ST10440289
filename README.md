The Cybersecurity Awareness Bot guides people in practicing online security during an interactive chat. By using keywords and looking at emotions, Artificial Intelligence deals with inquiries about phishing, passwords, privacy and scams in a way that speaks directly to the person asking. Individuals can communicate their emotions, discuss their interests or ask for advice and the bot responds with welcome tips and further questions to increase user involvement. Having ASCII art and optional audio greetings on the site makes it friendly and simple for everyone to explore cybersecurity tips.
